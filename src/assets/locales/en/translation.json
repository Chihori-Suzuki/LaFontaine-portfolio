    "intro": "Fontaine means `spring` in French.\nWater is the source of life, and a spring is where water overflows.\n\nWe chose this name because We want to share happiness and spirit of enjoying music.\nFor the reason that we put '...' is with the idea of permanence. \n\nWe hope that our group will continue this troupe for a long time to come and that it will never be complete. \n\nTo be a warm place like home for everyone. Our goal is to be a place where we can continue to create  high quality music.",
